# Guess-game
This is a guess my number game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It is originally an idea from Jonas Schmedtmann course, so I redesigned and redeveloped. I added some new designs and functionalities/logic.
Designed it using Figma, created the flowchart using figma also and I developed it on my mobile phone.
There are three modes - Easy, Normal and Advanced mode.
You can also click on the how to play button for help

 -------- EASY MODE --------
 -
You are to guess a number between 1 and 15, click on check.
You have 30 guesses. You lose the game once you run out of guesses
If the number guess is lower than the secret number, a message will be displayed that it is "Too low!"
If the number guess is higher than the secret number, a message will also be displayed that it is "Too high".
Note that: Whenever your guesses are wrong (low or high), your point/score is reduced.
Then if your guess is correct, a modal will pop up telling you "Congratulations, you won the game!" and also the background colour will change and your highscore will be displayed
You can click on the again button to continue.
